		 Periodic - a repeating event library
		 ------------------------------------
		  David Shaw <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

There isn't a lot that needs to be said about this library.
Basically, it acts like a "cron" inside a program.  You give it a list
of functions that need to be run and how often you want them to run,
and periodic schedules and runs them as needed.  I've written the
rough equivalent of this code a number of times in various jobs, and
it became time to just write a nice robust version of it, give it a
clean API, and release it as a library.  If nothing else, now I don't
have to write it over again.

See the periodic.h header for instructions, and the examples directory
for sample code.
